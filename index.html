<p>A HOME OF DIGNITY
    Founded in 2016, Based in Mandela Road, Alahleni South Africa 
    the New Life Children’s Home aims to provide a place of love, 
    safety, care, and Godliness to the most vulnerable members of society – the orphans. 
    The city of eMalahleni is in Crisis. Every day more and more kids are losing their parents and more child-headed households are being created. Currently there are around 6000 orphans in eMalahleni and there is not one single childrens home to meet this need. There isn’t a permanent place that these children can call home
    With each donation, We are one step closer to Creating more permanent and State of The art Container Homes.
    It's time to do something about it. Let's not allow this to happen on our watch.  
    The New Life Children Home will be the first of its kind in eMalahleni and you can be part of making history.
